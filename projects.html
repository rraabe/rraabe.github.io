            The purpose of this project was to develop a command line interface game that would take user input using

            defining a range of numbers and have the computer guess the number in the minimum number of tries. The game
            then switches to having
            the computer pick a number and the player guesses. Wins and total guesses are tracked across a session and
            reported in a summary at
            the end. This project uses exclusively JavaScript and a terminal.

            to create a world and track a user through a choose your own adventure. The scope was limited to only a few
            rooms but the structure of the game allows for quick and easy implementation of additional rooms, items, and
            interactions.

            Our first web-based project. This Tic-Tac-Toe game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was our first foray
            into
            <a class="link-in-text"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events" target="_blank"

              events
            </a>
            , and more specifically,
            <a class="link-in-text" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              listeners
            </a>
            . Using an event listener on the board element allowed me to capture where the user was clicking and then
            use JavaScript and some logic to enter either an X
            or an O. Some additional logic also allows the computer to play against the player by tracking which cells
            are available. The computer can even play against
            itself. Future work on this project will start with refactoring the code to implement the board as an object
            with the functions currently used moved to
            methods on the board object. This will allow for less explicit coding and more flexibility in future game
            modes and design. Additionally, more AI logic
            will be added to allow the computer to pick non-randomly. Ideally, selecting a difficulty level will select
            different AI logic.

            For this project, we were tasked with designing a website to match pictures we were given. This project used
            HTML and CSS with a focus on
            <a class="link-in-text" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener">flexbox</a>

            , and

              rel="noopener">forms</a>
            .
            This was also our first multi-page project which allowed us to use anchor tags and elements that responded
            to hovering and clicking. While not required for this project,
            we attempted to use CSS that allowed our website to scale reasonably well. This involved using fractional
            sizes in our grids and vh/vw units for our element sizing. These
            fairly simple techniques allowed for resizing of all text and elements on the page.
