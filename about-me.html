        <p>
          I was born and raised in southern Maine before moving to Richmond, VA to attend the University of Richmond.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating with a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I spent a year researching the interactions
          between
          <a class="link-in-text" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809336/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">
            anti-depressants and neurotransmitters</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the next two years developing and testing a rapid, point-of-care influenza test during the height of
          swine flu pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved back to Richmond, VA in 2011 to attend Virginia Commonwealth University. I researched the genes that
          affect the initial
          response to alcohol and I did it by getting tiny worms drunk. <a class="link-in-text"
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25162400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Yes really</a> and I graduated with a Masters in Pharmacology and Toxicology in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few weeks after graduating I got married to the most amazing person I've ever met.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I started working for <a class="link-in-text" href="https://www.ppdi.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc.</a> (PPD) developing and validating immunoassays to
          determine
          therapeutic and anti-therapeutic antibody concentrations in clinical trial samples. It was fast-paced, highly
          regulated, and offered as
          many challenges as it did problems to troubleshoot. I focused my efforts on developing assays that not only
          performed to the standards required,
          but that also streamlined the work for the analyst performing the method. This focus on the assay's user
          decreased the number of steps, reduced error
          rates, and shortened the time required to test samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our daughter was born in May 2017 and by January 2018 we had moved to Burlington, VT to be closer to our
          families.
          I worked for a company that tested raw and finished water samples for water treatment plants to meet EPA
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June 2019 I decided that I wanted new problems to solve in a field that was always evolving and demanded
          continued learning. I enrolled in
          the Burlington Code Academy boot camp and started my journey into web and software development.
